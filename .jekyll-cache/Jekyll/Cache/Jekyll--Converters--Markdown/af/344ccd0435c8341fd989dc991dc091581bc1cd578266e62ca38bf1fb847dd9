I"g<p>“Raising a maker-kid doesn’t mean we have to outfit our homes or classrooms with high tech equipment or tools.” What is makerspace? It is a place where students can learn to use material, tools, design, and create a prototype using their hands-on skills and scientific knowledge. It encourages students to explore, tinker, and build while understanding the integration of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in everyday life. “It is a place where students can go and have an opportunity to explore their own interests; learn to use tools and materials to create and solve problems. ”</p>
