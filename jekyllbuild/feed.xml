				<title>Session 6 STEM Makerspace</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;“Raising a maker-kid doesn’t mean we have to outfit our homes or classrooms with high tech equipment or tools.” What is makerspace? It is a place where students can learn to use material, tools, design, and create a prototype using their hands-on skills and scientific knowledge. It encourages students to explore, tinker, and build while understanding the integration of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in everyday life. “It is a place where students can go and have an opportunity to explore their own interests; learn to use tools and materials to create and solve problems. ”&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Session 5 Designing and Thinking with 3D</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard design thinking, actually I had no special experience with this tool at that time and just thought it’s a tool, a bit like brainstorming. But it is not the same as brainstorming, it will test and verify everyone’s ideas, thus ensure the feasibility of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
